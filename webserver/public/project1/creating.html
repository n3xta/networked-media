    <h1>Creating</h1>
    <p class="blog-content">
      NYU is one of the only two schools where I applied as an art major instead
      of a computer science major.<br /><br />
      When I applied to IMA, my resume was filled with academic records and
      awards. I was constantly in a low mood, numbly following instructions from
      my high school instructors, practicing coding, attending contests, mostly
      failing, and occasionally earning another line for my resume. But even
      though my mind was in total chaos, something, a thought from nowhere, was
      dragging me toward applying to at least one art school. Maybe it has
      something to do with the question: Why did I even enjoy coding when I was
      small?<br /><br />

      I’ve been tinkering with various small games using things like Scratch
      since elementary school, and by high school, they changed into Python,
      C++, and JS. Looking back now, most of them are pretty much trash,
      especially the ones I messed around with before the application season,
      before high school. But during the process of tinkering with this ‘trash,’
      I was happy. I realized I was <strong>creating</strong> something, and I
      was so close to being able to truly bring something from my mind to
      life.<br /><br />

      <strong>I enjoyed coding because I enjoy creating.</strong><br /><br />

      I was simply fascinated by how they operate, and how they create complex
      interactions with humans, starting from the two value logic of machine
      code. I also wanted to create by building something that only computers
      can make possible.
