    <p class="blog-content">Iâ€™m a rhythm game player, if that could tell anything. And making charts (levels) for those
        games is basically creating instructions for players to interact with elements on the screen. I myself is a
        charter, so as I conpete with other players to gain a worldwide record, I also create levels for the community
        to play. I always feel that among all mediums, game is the most interactive art, while among all games, rhythm
        games provide the purest interactions.</p>
