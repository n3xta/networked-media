    <h1>Rediscovering</h1>
    <p class="blog-content">I thought about an experience not a long time ago when the minecraft redstone friend
        mentioned earlier went to UIUC to study computer science and music. He showed me an undergoing music he was
        grinding on, and I wouldn’t deny, that it was better than 90% of my youtube feeding. I don’t know if there’s
        something to do with us having the same music taste or the fact that we often have a greater appreciation for
        our friends’ creations. That track was visualized in my head when I first listened to it and I wanted to make it
        go live so badly. In fact, I want to bring a lot of music to life, not just as tracks, but as a multi-sensory
        experience. The combination of sound, light, and motion in a space is something you can now simulate with tools
        like UE5 and AE, and that’s something that I feel thrilled about even just thinking about it. I could say that
        I’m finally learning something for <strong>creating</strong>.<br><br>Mumu Li<br>Oct 22, 2024</p>
