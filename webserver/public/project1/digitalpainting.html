      The other day I was scrolling through my Procreate and found that I used
      to draw a lot more than I remembered. I did have a lot of ideas and sparks
      during that time. What a digital device provides to artists differs
      significantly from physical paint and tools. Digital platforms operate on
      a fundamentally different framework: pixels instead of pigment, and
      algorithms instead of manual techniques. Every stroke is translated into
      binary code, interpreted by a processor, and rendered through layers of
      display technology, allowing for infinite revision, replication, and
      manipulation, which is not possible with physical media, where each
      brushstroke leaves a permanent mark and materials have inherent
      limitations. If traditional painting offers opportunities and
      possibilities under these strokes, the digital medium offers more.

      Software also offers precision, with tools functioning at a computational
      level that eliminates the risk of irreversible mistakes, which
      fundamentally changes the creative process. I used to customize my brush
      sets in that software. The algorithms behind brushes and effects simulate
      real-world textures and behaviors, but they’re ultimately governed by
      mathematics—enabling effects that defy physical constraints, and that’s
      amusing for me. And then my amount of artwork reduced sharply. I was
      sharply pointed out by my close friend that I “stopped drawing unless
      getting a commission”, which is not wrong at all. The only things I drew
      this year were four anime profile pics. My friends gave me the character
      designs and asked me to draw in certain styles. I did. It’s just four
      profile pics. I could have done the same thing on a canvas, it wouldn’t
      make a difference. I quitted creating.
