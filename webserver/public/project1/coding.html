    <h1>2. Coding</h1>
    <p class="blog-content">
      All of my coding programs in high school are dead by now. I didn’t renew
      the server subscription anymore, nor did I continue with maintenance or
      troubleshooting. The last website I shut down was the campus BBS. A bug
      had appeared, and with the already low user base, the backend management
      became chaotic. So I just decided to shut it down. Deep down I know that
      these projects were more about appearances. Perhaps when I initially came
      up with these ideas, I genuinely wanted to do something for the people at
      my high school, but over time, they gradually slipped into the “flexing
      zone.” They are allowed to be present in my high school life only because
      they enhanced the chance of my getting into CMU, and for every part of
      them, some unique abilities and qualities must be exposed to the
      Admissions Officers. The plan was clear: one project for software, one for
      hardware, and one for integration.

      But I do remember that I was coding to create. I started learning my first
      programming language because I wanted to use the command block in
      Minecraft to build a puzzle map that would transport players and display
      scripts on the screen. One of my best friends was into redstone mechanics,
      data packets, and triggers at the time, so we kind of worked together. The
      addictive potential of coding lies in how each roadblock pushes you to
      learn something new, and soon I was hooked not just on Minecraft, but on
      the thrill of coding itself. I developed this strange drive not just to
      make things work, but to make them work well. The more I coded, the more I
      saw technical skills like debugging, optimization, and scalability as a
      form of creation. People say coding is an art, and in fact, everything
      becomes art when you’re focused on creating something.

      Later in high school, the "how crowded is the cafeteria" queue project is
      probably the only one that had anything to do with “creativity,” but even
      then, it was just a data showcase platform, meant to “benefit the
      community,” and it only went live for two weeks. The teachers expressed
      concerns about underage privacy and camera safety because too many
      students were using the app, and they were worried that the camera footage
      from my Raspberry Pi might lead to issues that neither of us fully
      understood. I tried to reassure them by explaining how the data was
      processed locally, but after a day or two, I stopped defending myself—I
      genuinely didn’t care if the program continued running. I had already
      gathered all the materials I needed for my application. At that moment, no
      one, including myself, really cared whether my code was producing
      something interesting, let alone creating something. I quitted creating.
